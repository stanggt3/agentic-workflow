## Preamble — Bootstrap Check

Before running this skill, verify the environment is set up:

```bash
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -n "$REMOTE_URL" ]; then
  REPO_SLUG=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed 's|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)\.git$|\1|;s|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)$|\1|' | tr '/' '-')
else
  REPO_SLUG=$(basename "$(pwd)")
fi
echo "repo-slug: $REPO_SLUG"

SKILLS_OK=true
for s in review postReview addressReview enhancePrompt bootstrap rootCause bugHunt bugReport shipRelease syncDocs weeklyRetro officeHours productReview archReview design-analyze design-language design-evolve design-mockup design-implement design-refine design-verify; do
  [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s" ] || SKILLS_OK=false
done

BRIDGE_OK=false
[ -f "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$HOME/.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null || echo /dev/null)")/../mcp-bridge/dist/mcp.js" ] 2>/dev/null && BRIDGE_OK=true

RULES_OK=false
[ -d ".claude/rules" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null)" ] && RULES_OK=true

echo "skills-symlinked: $SKILLS_OK"
echo "bridge-built: $BRIDGE_OK"
echo "rules-directory: $RULES_OK"
```

Domain rules in `.claude/rules/` load automatically per glob — no action needed if `rules-directory: true`.

If `SKILLS_OK=false` or `BRIDGE_OK=false`, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
> "Agentic Workflow is not fully set up. Run setup.sh now? (yes/no)"

If **yes**: run `bash <path-to-agentic-workflow>/setup.sh` (resolve path from the review skill symlink target).
If **no**: warn that some features may not work, then continue.

If `RULES_OK=false` (and `SKILLS_OK` and `BRIDGE_OK` are both true), do not offer setup.sh. Instead, show:
> "Domain rules not found — run `/bootstrap` to generate `.claude/rules/` for this repo."

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/reviews"
```

# Address PR Review

Implements fixes for outstanding review issues. The local state file is the source of truth — run this as many times as needed until all issues are resolved.

## Step 1: Resolve the PR

**If an argument was provided**, use it directly:
```bash
gh pr view <argument> --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url,headRepository
```

**If no argument**, auto-detect from the current branch:
```bash
gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json number,title,url
```

If multiple PRs are found, list them and ask the user to pick one.

If no PRs are found: "No open PR found for the current branch. Use `/addressReview <number>` to specify one."

## Step 2: Load State File

Read `~/.agentic-workflow/{REPO_SLUG}/reviews/{number}.json`.

If the file does not exist:
> "No local review state found for PR #{number}. Run `/review` first."

## Step 3: Fetch New Human Comments from GitHub

Fetch all GitHub comments created **after** `reviewed_at` in the state file:

```bash
# Top-level issue comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.created_at > "{reviewed_at}") | {id, body, user: .user.login, created_at, path: null, diff_position: null, source: "human"}]'

# Inline PR review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.created_at > "{reviewed_at}") | {id, body, user: .user.login, created_at, path, position, source: "human"}]'
```

Filter out comments posted by bots or CI systems (check `user.login` for `[bot]` suffix or known CI usernames).

Append any new comments to a `human_comments` array in the state file. Update `human_comments_fetched_at` to now.

## Step 4: Build the Issue List

Collect all unaddressed items:

**From state file** (`addressed: false`):
- All issues across all `reviewers[].issues` entries

**From new human comments** (all — humans comment when something needs attention):
- Each comment becomes a candidate issue for triage

**Filter by severity** (for structured issues):
- Default: `blocking` and `issue` only
- Pass `--all` to include `suggestion` and `nit`

Report to the user:
```
PR #{number}: "{title}"

Outstanding items:
  X blocking   (structured)
  Y issue      (structured)
  Z new human comments
  (W suggestions/nits skipped — pass --all to include)

Already addressed: N items
```

If everything is already addressed, stop:
> "All review items have been addressed. Consider running /postReview if you haven't published yet."

## Step 5: Triage for Implementation

Spawn a **general-purpose** subagent with the triage prompt from [address-triage-prompt.md](address-triage-prompt.md).

Inject:
- `{structured_issues}` — JSON array of unaddressed structured issues
- `{human_comments}` — JSON array of new human comments
- `{diff}` — output of `gh pr diff {number}`
- `{file_list}` — changed file paths

Parse the returned JSON array of implementation assignments.

## Step 6: Checkout and Spawn Parallel Implementers

Check out the PR branch:
```bash
gh pr checkout {number}
```

Then spawn **all implementation agents simultaneously** in a single message. Each receives the prompt from [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md) with:
- `{agent}`, `{focus}`, `{issues}` — from triage output
- `{number}`, `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{branch}` — PR coordinates

## Step 7: Update State File

After all implementers complete, update `~/.agentic-workflow/{REPO_SLUG}/reviews/{number}.json`:

For each issue that was addressed:
- Set `"addressed": true`
- Set `"addressed_at"` to current ISO timestamp
- Set `"addressed_by"` to the agent name
- Set `"fix_commit"` to the commit SHA the agent reported

For new human comments that were addressed, add them to the state file under `human_comments` with the same fields.

Update `"last_addressed_at"` at the top level.

Use the Edit tool to update the file.

## Step 8: Report

```
Address complete for PR #{number}: "{title}"

Implemented:
  • security-engineer — 2 issues fixed (commit abc1234)
  • typescript-pro — 1 issue fixed (commit def5678)

Still outstanding (if any):
  [blocking] src/auth.ts — JWT not verified (agent error — address manually)

Run /addressReview again to continue, or /postReview to publish.
```
