## Codebase Navigation

Prefer **Serena** for all code exploration — LSP-based symbol lookup is faster and more precise than file scanning.

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Find a function, class, or symbol | `serena: find_symbol` |
| What references symbol X? | `serena: find_referencing_symbols` |
| Module/file structure overview | `serena: get_symbols_overview` |
| Search for a string or pattern | `Grep` (fallback) |
| Read a full file | `Read` (fallback) |

## Preamble — Bootstrap Check

Before running this skill, verify the environment is set up:

```bash
# Derive repo slug
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -n "$REMOTE_URL" ]; then
  REPO_SLUG=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed 's|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)\.git$|\1|;s|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)$|\1|' | tr '/' '-')
else
  REPO_SLUG=$(basename "$(pwd)")
fi
echo "repo-slug: $REPO_SLUG"

# Check bootstrap status
SKILLS_OK=true

  [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s" ] || SKILLS_OK=false
done

BRIDGE_OK=false
lsof -i TCP:3100 -sTCP:LISTEN &>/dev/null && BRIDGE_OK=true

RULES_OK=false
[ -d ".claude/rules" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null)" ] && RULES_OK=true

echo "skills-symlinked: $SKILLS_OK"
echo "bridge-running: $BRIDGE_OK"
echo "rules-directory: $RULES_OK"
```

Domain rules in `.claude/rules/` load automatically per glob — no action needed if `rules-directory: true`.

If `SKILLS_OK=false` or `BRIDGE_OK=false`, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
> "Agentic Workflow is not fully set up. Run setup.sh now? (yes/no)"

If **yes**: run `bash <path-to-agentic-workflow>/setup.sh` (resolve path from the review skill symlink target).
If **no**: warn that some features may not work, then continue.

If `RULES_OK=false` (and `SKILLS_OK` and `BRIDGE_OK` are both true), do not offer setup.sh. Instead, show:
> "Domain rules not found — run `/bootstrap` to generate `.claude/rules/` for this repo."

Create the output directory for this repo:
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG"
```

# Post Review to GitHub

Reads the local review state file and publishes all findings to GitHub in batched API calls — one review submission per agent.

## Step 1: Resolve the PR number

**If an argument was provided**, use it.

**If no argument**, detect from current branch:
```bash
gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json number,title,url
```

If multiple PRs found, list and ask the user to pick.

## Step 2: Load State File

Read `~/.agentic-workflow/{REPO_SLUG}/reviews/{number}.json`.

If the file does not exist:
> "No local review found for PR #{number}. Run `/review` first."

If `posted: true`:
> "PR #{number} was already posted at {posted_at}. Post again anyway? (yes/no)"
> Wait for confirmation before continuing.

## Step 3: Post Each Reviewer's Findings

For each entry in `reviewers`, post **one batched GitHub review** containing all that agent's inline comments plus a top-level summary body. This is a single API call per reviewer.

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --field commit_id="{commit_sha}" \
  --field body="{review_body}" \
  --field event="COMMENT" \
  --field "comments[]={inline_comments_json}"
```

Where:
- `{review_body}` is the reviewer's human-readable summary (see format below)
- `{inline_comments_json}` is a JSON array of all `type: "inline"` issues for this reviewer

### Review body format

```markdown
## {agent} Review
**Focus:** {focus}

{summary}

### Findings

| Severity | File | Issue |
|----------|------|-------|
| blocking | `src/auth.ts` | JWT not verified before use |
| issue | `src/api.ts` | SQL injection risk |

{top_level_issue_bodies}

<!-- review-data
{
  "agent": "{agent}",
  "focus": "{focus}",
  "issues": [ ... full issues array from state file ... ]
}
-->
```

`{top_level_issue_bodies}` — append the full `body` text of any `type: "top-level"` issues directly into the review body.

### Inline comment format

Each `type: "inline"` issue maps to:
```json
{
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "position": 42,
  "body": "**[blocking] JWT not verified**\n\nFull comment text..."
}
```

### Capture posted comment IDs

Parse the response to get the review ID and individual comment IDs:
```bash
RESPONSE=$(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews \
  --method POST ... )

REVIEW_ID=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq '.id')
```

Store each returned comment ID back against the issue in the state file (`posted_comment_id`).

## Step 4: Update State File

After all reviews are posted, update `~/.agentic-workflow/{REPO_SLUG}/reviews/{number}.json`:
- Set `"posted": true`
- Set `"posted_at"` to current ISO timestamp
- Fill in `posted_comment_id` for each issue

Use the Edit tool to update the file.

## Step 5: Report

```
Posted to PR #{number}: "{title}"

  • security-sentinel — 3 comments (2 inline, 1 top-level)
  • kieran-typescript-reviewer — 2 comments (2 inline)
  • performance-oracle — 1 comment (1 top-level)
