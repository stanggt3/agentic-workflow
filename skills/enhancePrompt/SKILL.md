# enhancePrompt

## Overview

Dynamically discovers project documentation, reads what's relevant to the user's prompt, and rewrites the request with full context — constraints, conventions, domain rules, and known patterns — before any work begins.

## Steps

### 1. Discover documentation

Scan the working directory for any of these (check what actually exists, don't assume):
- Root-level guides: `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Docs folders: `docs/`, `planning/`, `wiki/`, `.docs/`, `documentation/`
- Domain files by keyword: any `*.md` at root or one level deep

List what you find. If nothing exists, say so and offer to enhance from conversation context alone.

### 2. Read selectively

Read files whose names or paths suggest relevance to the user's prompt topic. Always read any root-level instruction file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`) first since they establish overall context. Then read topic-specific files.

Use judgment — a prompt about pricing doesn't need the testing strategy doc.

### 3. Evaluate Codex dialogue value

Before producing output, assess whether the task would benefit from a Codex consultation via the MCP bridge (`agentic-bridge`). Include a dialogue recommendation **only** when at least one of these applies:

- **Cross-domain task** — the prompt spans areas where a second agent working in parallel would reduce total time (e.g., frontend + backend, infra + application code)
- **Second opinion valuable** — architecture decisions, security-sensitive changes, or unfamiliar codebases where an independent review adds confidence
- **Parallel research** — the task involves investigating multiple approaches or technologies that could be explored simultaneously
- **Verification needed** — the result should be validated by a separate agent (e.g., "implement X, then have Codex try to break it")

If none apply, skip the dialogue section entirely — don't force it.

### 4. Output the enhanced prompt

```
## Enhanced Prompt

**Original:** <user's exact words>

**Relevant context from project docs:**
<concise bullets — constraints, conventions, patterns, gotchas that apply>

**Full task:**
<rewritten version of the prompt with all context woven in, specific and actionable>
```

If step 3 identified dialogue value, append:

```
## Codex Dialogue Recommended

**Why:** <one sentence — which criterion triggered this>

**What to ask Codex:**
<specific prompt to send via agentic-bridge assign_task or send_context>

**Expected value:** <what the response would add — a review, alternative approach, parallel implementation, etc.>

**How to initiate:**
  In a Codex session: "Check your unread messages on the agentic-bridge"
  Or manually: assign_task with conversation UUID, domain, and the prompt above
```

If step 3 found no dialogue value, do not include this section.

### 5. Confirm before proceeding

Ask: "Should I proceed with this, or adjust anything?"

Do NOT begin executing the task during this skill.

## Rules

- Generic by design — works for any domain: software, product, business analysis, research, etc.
- Preserve the user's original intent exactly; only add context, never redirect.
- Skip docs that aren't relevant — don't dump everything found.
- If the prompt is already detailed, say so and ask if enhancement is still wanted.
- If no docs exist, enhance from what's known in the conversation.
