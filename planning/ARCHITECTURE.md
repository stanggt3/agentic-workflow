# Agentic Workflow Architecture

## System Overview

Agentic Workflow is a portable Claude Code toolkit with four independent components: a set of custom skills for multi-agent PR review, a documentation bootstrapper skill, a TypeScript MCP bridge server for inter-agent communication, and a Next.js 15 conversation dashboard UI. The skills are installed by symlinking into `~/.claude/skills/` and invoked as slash commands inside Claude Code sessions. The MCP bridge runs as either a stdio MCP server (registered with `claude mcp add`) or a standalone Fastify REST API, persisting messages and tasks to a local SQLite database so agents can exchange context asynchronously. The UI connects to the bridge REST API and receives real-time updates via SSE.

## Component 1: Skills (skills/, bootstrap/)

### Overview

Five Claude Code custom skills defined as Markdown SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter. Skills are slash commands that Claude Code executes as structured workflows. They use the `Agent` tool to spawn parallel subagents and `gh` CLI for GitHub API access.

### Review Pipeline (skills/review/)

A three-phase PR review workflow with a shared state file (`.review-cache/{number}.json`) as the coordination mechanism:

**Phase 1 — `/review`:** Fetches PR diff and metadata via `gh`, spawns a triage subagent to classify changed files into domain-specific reviewer assignments (from a catalog of 12+ specialist agents like `security-sentinel`, `kieran-typescript-reviewer`, `performance-oracle`). All reviewers run in parallel via the `Agent` tool. Each returns structured JSON with severity-tagged issues (`blocking`, `issue`, `suggestion`, `nit`) including `diff_position` for inline placement. Results are written to `.review-cache/{number}.json`.

**Phase 2 — `/postReview`:** Reads the state file and publishes findings to GitHub as batched PR reviews (one `gh api` call per reviewer agent). Captures posted comment IDs back into the state file. Marks `posted: true`.

**Phase 3 — `/addressReview`:** Reads the state file, fetches any new human comments from GitHub since `reviewed_at`, runs an address-triage subagent to group all unresolved issues by implementation concern, then spawns parallel implementer subagents. Implementers fix code, commit, push, and reply to every comment. The state file is updated with `addressed: true` and commit SHAs. Can be re-run iteratively.

### Prompt Enhancer (skills/enhancePrompt/)

A utility skill that discovers project documentation files (CLAUDE.md, planning/, docs/), reads those relevant to the user's current request, and rewrites the prompt with injected context before execution. Used by `/bootstrap` as its first step.

### Bootstrap (bootstrap/)

Orchestrates generation of up to 17 Pivot-pattern planning documents (ARCHITECTURE, ERD, API_CONTRACT, TESTING, etc.) plus a CLAUDE.md for any repository. Audits existing coverage by searching for docs under flexible name patterns, then spawns batched `Agent` subagents (4-5 at a time) to research and write missing docs. Adapts content to the target repo's actual tech stack.

## Component 2: MCP Bridge (mcp-bridge/)

### Overview

A TypeScript application providing two transport layers over the same business logic: a Fastify REST API (for HTTP clients) and an MCP stdio server (for Claude Code tool calls). Both transports share the same `DbClient` and application services. The bridge enables asynchronous message-passing between AI agents using a SQLite store-and-forward pattern.

### Layered Architecture

The bridge follows a strict three-layer architecture with unidirectional dependencies:

**Transport Layer** (`transport/`, `routes/`, `server.ts`) — Handles HTTP request parsing, Zod validation, and response formatting. The `defineRoute<TSchema>()` identity function captures the generic `TSchema` type parameter, linking Zod schemas to handler signatures at compile time. The Fastify server iterates over `ControllerDefinition[]` arrays, registering each route with automatic Zod validation of `params`, `query`, and `body`. POST routes return 201; errors map `statusHint` to HTTP status codes; `ZodError` maps to 400.

**Application Layer** (`application/`) — Pure functions that accept a `DbClient` and input, returning `AppResult<T>`. The `AppResult<T>` type is a discriminated union: `{ ok: true, data: T } | { ok: false, error: AppError }`. Services never throw. Multi-step operations (e.g., `assignTask` inserts both a task and a notification message) are wrapped in `db.transaction()` for atomicity.

**Data Layer** (`db/`) — `schema.ts` runs DDL migrations on startup (idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`). `client.ts` exposes a `DbClient` interface with pre-compiled prepared statements. All IDs are UUIDs generated via `crypto.randomUUID()`. The database uses WAL journal mode for concurrent read performance.

### Data Model

Two tables with conversation-based partitioning:

**messages** — `id` (UUID PK), `conversation` (UUID), `sender`, `recipient`, `kind` (enum: context | task | status | reply), `payload` (text), `meta_prompt` (nullable), `created_at`, `read_at` (nullable, set on retrieval). Indexed on `conversation` and `(recipient, read_at)`.

**tasks** — `id` (UUID PK), `conversation` (UUID), `domain`, `summary`, `details`, `analysis` (nullable), `assigned_to` (nullable), `status` (enum: pending | in_progress | completed | failed), `created_at`, `updated_at`. Indexed on `conversation` and `status`.

### MCP Tools (mcp.ts)

Five tools exposed over stdio transport:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `send_context` | Insert a message with kind=context into a conversation |
| `get_messages` | Retrieve full conversation history by UUID |
| `get_unread` | Fetch unread messages for a recipient, atomically marking them read |
| `assign_task` | Create a task + notification message in one transaction |
| `report_status` | Send a status message and optionally update task status |

### REST API (index.ts + server.ts)

Ten endpoints on Fastify (default `127.0.0.1:3100`):

| Method | Path | Handler |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check (returns `{ status: "ok" }`) |
| POST | `/messages/send` | `sendContext` service |
| GET | `/messages/conversation/:conversation` | `getMessagesByConversation` service |
| GET | `/messages/unread?recipient=` | `getUnreadMessages` service |
| POST | `/tasks/assign` | `assignTask` service |
| GET | `/tasks/:id` | Direct `db.getTask()` lookup |
| GET | `/tasks/conversation/:conversation` | Direct `db.getTasksByConversation()` lookup |
| POST | `/tasks/report` | `reportStatus` service |
| GET | `/conversations?limit=&offset=` | `getConversations` service — paginated summaries |
| GET | `/events` | SSE stream — emits `message:created`, `task:created`, `task:updated`; heartbeat every 30s |

The server refuses to bind to non-loopback addresses unless `ALLOW_REMOTE=1` is set, since the API has no authentication. CORS is enabled (via `@fastify/cors`) to allow the local UI at `:3000` to connect.

### EventBus (application/events.ts)

An in-process pub/sub bus created once in `index.ts` and passed into controller factories. Controllers call `bus.emit(event)` after successful writes. The SSE route handler subscribes to all event types and forwards events to connected clients as `data:` lines. The EventBus interface:

```
createEventBus() → EventBus
  .on(type, handler)   — subscribe
  .off(type, handler)  — unsubscribe
  .emit(event)         — publish
```

Event union: `BridgeEvent = MessageCreatedEvent | TaskCreatedEvent | TaskUpdatedEvent`

### Component 4: UI Dashboard (ui/)

A Next.js 15 App Router application that provides a visual interface for bridge activity.

**Conversation list (`/`):** Paginated list of conversation summaries with participant names, message/task counts, and last-activity time. Supports UUID-based filtering. SSE via `use-sse` hook triggers refetch on `message:created`, `task:created`, and `task:updated` events.

**Conversation detail (`/conversation/[id]`):** Three-panel layout: timeline (chronological messages + tasks with expand/collapse), directed graph (Mermaid `graph TD`), and sequence diagram (Mermaid `sequenceDiagram`). Diagrams are built client-side from fetched data via `src/lib/diagrams.ts`.

**Reverse proxy:** `next.config.ts` proxies all `/api/*` requests to `http://localhost:3100/*`, so the UI never makes cross-origin requests to the bridge directly.

## Component 3: Config Archive (config/)

Archived Claude Code configuration for replication across machines:

- **settings.json** — Sets model to `opus`, enables plugins (github, superpowers, compound-engineering, swift-lsp, playwright), enables experimental agent teams flag, sets effort level to `high`.
- **mcp.json** — Registers the `mobai` MCP server (`npx -y mobai-mcp`).

## Key Rules

1. **Skills are stateless Markdown.** Each skill is a SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`, `disable-model-invocation`). The Markdown body is the prompt — Claude Code executes it step-by-step. No runtime code, no build step.

2. **The review state file is the coordination contract.** `.review-cache/{number}.json` is the single source of truth shared across `/review`, `/postReview`, and `/addressReview`. All three skills read and write this file. It tracks per-issue metadata: severity, diff position, addressed status, posted comment IDs.

3. **Application services never throw.** Every service function returns `AppResult<T>` — a discriminated union of `ok(data)` or `err(AppError)`. Error propagation uses value returns, not exceptions. The transport layer maps `AppError.statusHint` to HTTP status codes.

4. **Type safety flows from Zod schemas through to handlers.** The `defineRoute<TSchema>()` generic captures the schema type, so `handler(req: ApiRequest<TSchema>)` gets fully inferred `params`, `query`, and `body` types. Schemas are defined once and shared between validation and type inference.

5. **Multi-step writes are transactional.** `assignTask` (task + message insert) and `reportStatus` (message + task update) wrap their operations in `db.transaction()`. `getUnreadMessages` atomically fetches and marks messages read.

6. **The bridge has no authentication.** The REST API binds to loopback only (`127.0.0.1`) by default and exits with an error if a non-loopback host is configured without `ALLOW_REMOTE=1`. This is a deliberate design choice for local-only multi-agent coordination.

7. **Subagents run in parallel via the Agent tool.** Both `/review` (reviewer subagents) and `/addressReview` (implementer subagents) spawn all agents simultaneously in a single message. Triage always runs sequentially first to determine the agent assignments.

8. **Setup is symlink-based.** `setup.sh` creates symlinks from `~/.claude/skills/` into this repo rather than copying files. Changes to skill definitions take effect immediately without re-running setup.

9. **The MCP server and REST API share identical business logic.** `mcp.ts` calls the same four service functions as the Fastify controllers. The only difference is transport: stdio with `resultToContent()` formatting vs. HTTP with `ApiResponse<T>` envelopes.

10. **SQLite is configured for concurrent access.** WAL journal mode is enabled on database creation, allowing multiple readers alongside a single writer — suitable for the bridge's pattern of multiple agents polling for unread messages.

11. **SSE uses an in-process EventBus, not polling.** The `GET /events` route registers a client handler with the EventBus. Controllers emit events after successful writes. No database polling occurs — events are synchronously emitted in the same process. Heartbeat comments (`:heartbeat`) are sent every 30 seconds to keep connections alive through proxies.

12. **The UI is a read-only observer.** The Next.js dashboard only makes GET requests to the bridge (plus the SSE stream). All writes go through MCP tools or direct REST calls from agents. The UI has no write path.
