# Design-to-Implementation Pipeline

> Structured design workflow: analyze reference sites, define a design language, generate mockups, implement across web and SwiftUI, refine with Impeccable commands, and verify with screenshot diffing.

## Problem

The current design-to-implementation workflow is unstructured and token-expensive. Each session requires re-describing aesthetics, ad-hoc prompting for mockups, manual tool coordination for verification, and no consistent way to maintain a design language across web and iOS targets. The result is low first-pass quality, inconsistent output, and high cognitive overhead.

## Goals (ordered by priority)

1. **Higher first-pass quality** — AI has full design context at every step, reducing iteration
2. **Repeatable, structured workflow** — invoke named skills instead of ad-hoc prompting
3. **Token efficiency** — design language persists across sessions, eliminating re-description

## Design Language Artifacts

Three files, complementary roles:

| File | Format | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| `planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | Markdown | Strategic design decisions, principles, component catalog | Written by `/bootstrap` or manually; upstream reference |
| `.impeccable.md` | Markdown | Brand personality, aesthetic direction, anti-references, design principles for AI consumption | Written by `/design-language`; references `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` |
| `design-tokens.json` | W3C DTCG JSON | Machine-readable tokens: colors, typography, spacing, radii, elevation, motion | Written by `/design-analyze`; consumed by Design Token Bridge MCP |

Relationship:

```
planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md  (what and why — principles, component catalog)
    |  referenced by
    v
.impeccable.md             (brand personality, aesthetic direction for AI)
design-tokens.json         (exact values — colors, typography, spacing)
```

Both `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json` live at the project root and are checked into git. They are living documents — `/design-evolve` updates them incrementally.

## Tool Installation

### New MCP Servers

| Server | Install | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Design Token Bridge | `npx -y design-token-bridge-mcp` | Extract tokens from CSS/Tailwind/Figma/JSON; generate SwiftUI themes, CSS vars, Tailwind config; validate WCAG contrast |

### New CLI Tools

| Tool | Install | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Dembrandt | `npm install -g dembrandt` (installed by `setup.sh`) | Analyze live websites; extract design tokens as W3C DTCG JSON |

### New Skills

| Skill | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Impeccable (20 commands) | Copy from `pbakaus/impeccable` dist/claude-code | Design refinement: `/colorize`, `/animate`, `/polish`, `/typeset`, `/arrange`, etc. |
| 7 `/design-*` skills | Custom, built in this repo | Pipeline orchestration (see below) |

### Optional

| Server | Install | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Figma MCP | Official remote endpoint or Figma Desktop | Read Figma designs, extract variables — if you use Figma |
| Mockuuups MCP | Remote endpoint | Generate professional device frame mockups from screenshots |

### Already in Place (no changes)

- Playwright MCP (web screenshots/automation)
- mobai MCP (iOS simulator automation)
- design-comparison MCP (pixel diffing)
- compound-engineering design agents (design-iterator, design-implementation-reviewer, figma-design-sync)
- gemini-imagegen skill

## Seven `/design-*` Skills

Individual skills with `design-` prefix, each visible via `/skills`:

```
~/.claude/skills/
├── design-analyze/SKILL.md
├── design-language/SKILL.md
├── design-evolve/SKILL.md
├── design-mockup/SKILL.md
├── design-implement/SKILL.md
├── design-refine/SKILL.md
└── design-verify/SKILL.md
```

### Skill Definitions

#### `/design-analyze`

- **Argument:** `<url> [url2...]` (one or more reference site URLs)
- **Purpose:** Run Dembrandt on reference sites, synthesize extracted tokens and AI analysis into a draft design language
- **Process:**
  1. Run `npx dembrandt <url> --dtcg --save-output` for each URL
  2. If `--dark-mode` variants are needed, run again with that flag
  3. Merge extracted tokens across sites (resolve conflicts by frequency/prominence)
  4. AI synthesizes patterns: what's shared across references, what's distinctive
  5. Write `design-tokens.json` to project root
  6. Present summary for review
- **Output:** `design-tokens.json` (W3C DTCG format)

#### `/design-language`

- **Argument:** none
- **Purpose:** Interactive session defining brand personality and aesthetic direction
- **Process:**
  1. Read `planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` if it exists (upstream context)
  2. Read `design-tokens.json` if it exists (extracted values)
  3. Ask strategic questions (similar to `/teach-impeccable`):
     - Users and purpose
     - Brand personality (3-word personality, references, anti-references)
     - Aesthetic preferences (style direction, light/dark mode, color constraints)
     - Accessibility requirements (WCAG level)
  4. Write `.impeccable.md` with references to `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and `design-tokens.json`
- **Output:** `.impeccable.md`

#### `/design-evolve`

- **Argument:** `<url>` (new reference site)
- **Purpose:** Analyze a new reference site mid-project and merge into existing design language
- **Process:**
  1. Read existing `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json`
  2. Run Dembrandt on new URL
  3. Present diff: what the new site adds or changes vs. current tokens
  4. Ask which elements to adopt, adapt, or ignore
  5. Update `design-tokens.json` and `.impeccable.md` incrementally
- **Output:** Updated `design-tokens.json` and `.impeccable.md`

#### `/design-mockup`

- **Argument:** `<screen-name>` (e.g., "dashboard", "login", "settings")
- **Purpose:** Generate an HTML mockup using the visual companion, informed by the design language
- **Process:**
  1. Load `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json`
  2. Generate HTML mockup as a content fragment for the visual companion
  3. Save to `.superpowers/brainstorm/` session directory
  4. Present in browser for review
  5. Iterate based on feedback until approved
  6. Screenshot the approved mockup as baseline for `/design-verify`
- **Output:** HTML mockup file, baseline screenshot saved to `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/`

#### `/design-implement`

- **Argument:** `<target>` — `web` or `swiftui`
- **Purpose:** Generate production code from an approved mockup
- **Process:**
  1. Load `.impeccable.md`, `design-tokens.json`, and the approved mockup
  2. Call Design Token Bridge MCP to generate platform-specific token files:
     - `web` → `generate_css_variables` + `generate_tailwind_config`
     - `swiftui` → `generate_swiftui_theme`
  3. Generate component/view code using the token files and Impeccable's frontend-design reference
  4. Commit generated token files (`tokens.css`, `tailwind.preset.js`, or `Theme.swift`)
- **Output:** Production code + generated token files

#### `/design-refine`

- **Argument:** `[impeccable-command]` (optional — e.g., `colorize`, `animate`, `polish`, `typeset`, `arrange`)
- **Purpose:** Dispatch Impeccable refinement commands with design language context pre-loaded
- **Process:**
  1. Load `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json`
  2. If no command specified, analyze current implementation and suggest which refinements would help most
  3. If command specified, dispatch that Impeccable skill with design context injected
  4. If token changes result from refinement, update `design-tokens.json`
- **Output:** Refined code, potentially updated `design-tokens.json`

#### `/design-verify`

- **Argument:** none
- **Purpose:** Screenshot the implementation, diff against the mockup baseline, report discrepancies
- **Process:**
  1. Detect target: web project, iOS project, or both
  2. Capture implementation screenshots:
     - Web → Playwright MCP (`browser_navigate`, `browser_take_screenshot` at mobile/tablet/desktop viewports)
     - iOS → mobai MCP (`get_screenshot`)
  3. Retrieve baseline mockup screenshot from `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/`
  4. Diff via design-comparison MCP (`compare_design`)
  5. Report:
     - Pass (< 2% diff): "Implementation matches mockup"
     - Minor (2-10% diff): list specific discrepancies, suggest fixes
     - Major (> 10% diff): side-by-side diff image, prioritized fix list
  6. If major diff, suggest dispatching `design-iterator` agent for automated multi-pass refinement
- **Output:** Verification report, diff images saved to `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/`

### Shared Preamble

All seven skills share a context-loading preamble (referenced from each SKILL.md):

1. Read `.impeccable.md` if it exists
2. Read `design-tokens.json` if it exists
3. Read `planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` if it exists
4. If none exist and the skill requires design context, advise running `/design-analyze` and `/design-language` first

### Pipeline

```
/design-analyze → /design-language → /design-mockup → /design-implement → /design-refine → /design-verify
                                   ^
                          /design-evolve (anytime)
```

## Token Flow

```
Reference site(s)
    |
    v
Dembrandt CLI (npx dembrandt <url> --dtcg --save-output)
    |
    v
design-tokens.json (W3C DTCG format, project root)
    |
    |---> Design Token Bridge MCP
    |       |-- generate_css_variables --> tokens.css (CSS custom properties + dark mode)
    |       |-- generate_tailwind_config --> tailwind.preset.js
    |       +-- generate_swiftui_theme --> Theme.swift (Color/Font/Spacing extensions)
    |
    +---> validate_contrast --> WCAG AA/AAA compliance report
```

### Key Decisions

1. **W3C DTCG as interchange format** — Dembrandt outputs it natively, Design Token Bridge consumes it, Style Dictionary can also read it. One format, multiple consumers.
2. **Generated files are committed** — `tokens.css`, `tailwind.preset.js`, and `Theme.swift` are checked into the project. Regenerated when tokens change, not on every build.
3. **Dark mode** — Design Token Bridge generates CSS vars with dark mode variants. SwiftUI theme uses `Color` assets respecting `colorScheme`. Dembrandt supports `--dark-mode` extraction.
4. **Updating tokens** — `/design-evolve` or manual edits to `design-tokens.json` trigger regeneration via `/design-implement`. The skill diffs output so you see what changed.

## Verification Loop

```
/design-verify
    |
    |-- Detect target: web? iOS? both?
    |
    |-- Web --> Playwright MCP
    |              |-- browser_navigate --> implementation URL
    |              |-- browser_take_screenshot --> impl-screenshot.png
    |              +-- (multiple viewports: mobile, tablet, desktop)
    |
    |-- iOS --> mobai MCP
    |              |-- get_screenshot --> impl-screenshot.png
    |              +-- (device variants if configured)
    |
    |-- Diff --> design-comparison MCP
    |              |-- compare_design(mockup.png, impl-screenshot.png)
    |              +-- returns: pixel diff %, diff image
    |
    +-- Report
           |-- Pass (< 2% diff) --> "Implementation matches mockup"
           |-- Minor (2-10% diff) --> list specific discrepancies, suggest fixes
           +-- Major (> 10% diff) --> side-by-side diff image, prioritized fix list
```

Mockup baselines are captured when `/design-mockup` output is approved. Both baselines and implementation screenshots are saved to `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/`.

After fixing discrepancies, re-run `/design-verify` to re-capture and re-diff. If diff is significant, the skill suggests dispatching compound-engineering's `design-iterator` agent for automated multi-pass refinement.

## Bootstrap Integration

### Changes to `/bootstrap` skill

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| Preamble skill table | Add 7 `/design-*` skill rows |
| Skill count | 14 → 21 everywhere |
| `DESIGN_SYSTEM` doc template | Add section pointing to `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json` as operational artifacts, with guidance to run `/design-analyze` and `/design-language` |
| CLAUDE.md template | Add "Design Language" section referencing all three files and the design skill pipeline |
| Step 7 suggested workflow | Insert design skills after planning, before implementation |

### Updated Skill Pipeline

```
officeHours → productReview / archReview → plan
    → design-analyze → design-language → design-mockup → design-implement → design-refine → design-verify
    → review → rootCause → bugHunt → shipRelease → syncDocs → weeklyRetro
```

### CLAUDE.md Design Language Section (template)

```markdown
## Design Language

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | Design principles, component catalog, strategic decisions |
| `.impeccable.md` | Brand personality + aesthetic direction (AI context) |
| `design-tokens.json` | W3C DTCG tokens (colors, typography, spacing) |

Run `/design-analyze <url>` to extract tokens from reference sites.
Run `/design-language` to define brand context.
```

## Open Questions for Planning

Advisory items from spec review — not blocking, but need resolution during implementation planning:

1. **`/design-refine` dispatch mechanics** — how does it invoke Impeccable skills? Via `Skill` tool, `Agent` tool with SKILL.md content, or inlined instructions?
2. **`/design-mockup` allowed-tools** — depends on Superpowers brainstorm visual companion; needs correct tool permissions in SKILL.md frontmatter
3. **`/design-verify` target detection** — heuristic for web vs iOS (e.g., presence of `Package.swift`/`.xcodeproj` for iOS, `package.json` with Next.js/React for web)
4. **`/design-implement` screen selection** — should take a `<screen-name>` argument when multiple mockups exist
5. **Impeccable installation strategy** — vendor into this repo, add to `setup.sh`, or leave as manual prerequisite?
6. **Generated token file placement** — root is fine for single-target projects; monorepos may need platform-specific subdirectories
